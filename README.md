**Covid-19 Case and Death Tracker Web App**
This Shiny WebApp displays 7 day rolling average time series of Covid-19 cases and deaths, as well as cumulative cases and deaths. The first tab shows time series by country, the second time series by states for the US only, and the third time series by county or municipality for the US only. The data were obtained from Johns Hopkins CSSE, for eductional/research use only. Not for medical use.
